Discover, follow, and manage Github's ask me anything (AMA) repositories.

#### Note
> I was so excited and committed to building this project.
> But most of the AMA repositories in Github are not active for years.
> It seems developers are not maintaining or following AMA
> repositories [anymore](https://twitter.com/MSuresh100/status/1435082847044321287?s=20).
> Hence, the idea is not worth the effort.
